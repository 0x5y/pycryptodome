SHA-384
=======

SHA-384 belongs to the SHA-2_ family of cryptographic hashes.
It produces the 384 bit digest of a message.

    >>> from Crypto.Hash import SHA384
    >>>
    >>> h = SHA384.new()
    >>> h.update(b'Hello')
    >>> print h.hexdigest()

*SHA* stands for Secure Hash Algorithm.

.. warning::
    SHA-384 is vulnerable to `length-extension attacks <https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3978/understanding-the-length-extension-attack>`_,
    which are relevant if you are computing the hash of a secret message.
    
    For instance, let's say you were planning to build a cheap MAC by concatenating a secret *key* to
    a public message *m* (bad idea!):
   
    .. math::
        h = \text{SHA-384}(m || k)
    
    By only knowing the digest *h* and the length of *m* and *k*, the attacker can easily compute a second digest *h'*:
    
    .. math::
        h' = \text{SHA-384}(m || p || z)
    
    where *p* is a well-known bit string and the attacker can pick a bit string *z* at will.
